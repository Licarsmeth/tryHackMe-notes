## Cracking Hashes
You can check online rainbow tables like hashes.com too instead for hashes that have already been cracked. 
- **Hashcat**
	- Hashcat uses the following basic syntax: `hashcat -m <hash_type> -a <attack_mode> hashfile wordlist`, where:
		- `-m <hash_type>` specifies the hash-type in numeric format. For example, `-m 1000` is for NTLM. Check the official documentation (`man hashcat`) and [example page](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) to find the hash type code to use.
		-   `-a <attack_mode>` specifies the attack-mode. For example, `-a 0` is for straight, i.e., trying one password from the wordlist after the other.
		-   `hashfile` is the file containing the hash you want to crack.
		-   `wordlist` is the security word list you want to use in your attack.
